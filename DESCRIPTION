Description: This is the R package of the SLICE algorithm, 
  which utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to quantitatively 
  measure cellular differentiation states based on single cell entropy 
  and predict cell differentiation lineages via the construction of entropy 
  directed cell trajectories.
